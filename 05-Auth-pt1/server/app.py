    # cd into server and run the following in the Terminal:
        # flask db init
        # flask db revision --autogenerate -m 'Create tables' 
        # flask db upgrade

    # Most common response codes
        # 200 = ok ( GET, PATCH )
        # 201 = created ( POST )
        # 204 = no content ( DELETE )
        # 404 = not found
        # 401 = unauthorized ( Login )
        # 422 = unprocessable entity ( Validation Errors )

# Let's start by moving most of our imports and other things into a new file called config.py
    # This will allow us to leave our app file focus just on routing and reduce clutter! Let's move lines 28-55!!! ðŸ«¡

# Before starting here, let's make sure our models are in order!!! ðŸŒŸ

# 1.âœ… Create a Signup route
    #1.1 Use add_resource to add a new endpoint '/signup' 
    #1.2 The signup route should have a post method
        #1.2.1 Get the values from the request body with get_json
        #1.2.2 Create a new user, however only pass email/username ( and any other values we may have )
        #1.2.3 Call the password_hash method on the new user and set it to the password from the request
        #1.2.4 Add and commit
        #1.2.5 Add the user id to session under the key of user_id
        #1.2.6 send the new user back to the client with a status of 201
    #1.3 Test out your route with the client or Postman

# 2.âœ… Test this route in the client/src/components/Authentication.sj 

# 3.âœ… Create a Login route
    # 3.1 Create a login class that inherits from Resource
    # 3.2 Use api.add_resource to add the '/login' path
    # 3.3 Build out the post method
        # 3.3.1 convert the request from json and select the user sent form the client. 
        # 3.3.2 Use the email/username to query the user with a .filter
            # If the user exists check to make sure they have the correct password using user.authenticate
        # 3.3.3 If found and password is correct set the user_id to the session hash
        # 3.3.4 convert the user to_dict and send a response back to the client 
    #3.4 Toggle the signup form to login and test the login route


# 4.âœ… Create an AuthorizedSession class that inherits from Resource
    # 4.1 use api.add_resource to add an authorized route
    # 4.2 Create a get method
        # 4.2.1 Access the user_id from session with session.get
        # 4.2.2 Use the user id to query the user with a .filter
        # 4.2.3 If the user id is in sessions and found make a response to send to the client. else raise the Unauthorized exception

# 5.âœ… Head back to client/src/App.js to restrict access to our app!

# 6.âœ… Logout 
    # 6.1 Create a class Logout that inherits from Resource 
    # 6.2 Create a method called delete
    # 6.3 Clear the user id in session by setting the key to None
    # 6.4 create a 204 no content response to send back to the client

# 7.âœ… Navigate to client/src/components/Navigation.js to build the logout button!
